Hello <%= @request.first %>,

We have received your submission of the DYHA Check Request form.  Here are a few important reminders about the Check Request process:

- Checks will be issued within 10 business days.
- Receipts must accompany each check request for verification.

Receipts may be submitted online via email or by delivering a copy to the DYHA office at the arena.  Your mobile phone camera is a quick and easy way to capture a receipt image that can sent via email.  

Receipts should be submitted to jacque.gomez@dyha.org.  For efficient processing it is recommended that email receipts be submitted with your Reference Id of <%= @key %> in the subject line

Thank You,

DYHA Online Services
